Developer with a second degree in civil engineering, committed to project management, leadership and construction methods intertwined with the universe of technology. During my career, I was involved in projects that explored the intersection between technology and  engineering, allowing me to understand how both areas complement each other. With this background, I made a successful transition to the **Software Development** area. Always looking for new challenges!
